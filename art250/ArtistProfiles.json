My work relies on the use of color and paint to represent energies; creative and destructive energies that are brought forth from us and brought to bare upon us.\r\n\r\n    My paintings are powerful images, vibrant and dynamic,  intended to invoke a response.

As a young girl, a pencil and lined paper sufficed as the tools used for my outlet. As I got older I experimented with colored pencils, paints, markers, and any other media I could get my hands on. Art class was my favorite time of the day in school and my parents further supported my passion by enrolling me in private art lessons with a local artist. \r\n\r\nI pursued art in high school and attended college where I double majored in art and education with the help of the Ruby McSwain Scholarship.\r\n\r\nMy graduation year, 2003, was a pivotal time in my life. I lost my high school best friend in a motorcycle accident and will never forget that day, as his family contacted me one morning as I was student teaching at a local middle school. Working through this tragedy not only taught me how fragile life truly is, but also opened my eyes to all that he had taught me and the reasons he was brought into my life. The experience awakened me to the importance of appreciating everything and everyday, not to ever take anything for granted, to cherish every moment and everything around me no matter how insignificant it may seem.\r\n\r\nAlthough I reflect on this year as the most difficult time in my life, this year also provided several delightful happenings: I graduated college, landed a job and met my future husband!\r\n\r\nI continue to teach high school art and also oversee the art department at my school. From scenic design to AP Art, each class I teach offers new projects to lead students through and I relish seeing their unique solutions to each prompt or problem I present to them. Although there is never a dull moment working with adolescents, I strive to constantly challenge myself and improve my methods, knowledge and teaching practices. \r\n\r\nI earned my National Boards for Professional Teaching Standards in 2007. I recently earned my M.A.Ed. in Art Education. I believe that personal learning and reflection not only models life-long learning for my students, but also keeps me rejuvenated and enthusiastic about my discipline. \r\n\r\nCreating my own art is essential for me. I mainly focus my efforts on painting and collaging, yet I enjoy other mediums as well. Nothing is more soothing than feeling a brush spread smooth acrylic paint across the surface of a rough canvas or reconstructing meaning through a patchwork of prefabricated images, colors and textures. My artwork is my escape. It is my world. It is the one aspect of life that I have complete and utter control of, therefore I construct imagery that is appealing to my eyes and meaningful to me, with the hope that others may connect to it as well.\r\n\r\nTo learn more go to www.jamielynnmooreart.com","artist":{"email":"jamielynnmooreart@yahoo.com","id":46}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"Box 2167","address2":"401 Crows Nest Road","city":"Fort Davis","first_name":"Lindy Cook","last_name":"Severns","state":"Texas","id":60,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/70/Lindy_and_Grey_in_rock_shelter_square.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/70/preview_Lindy_and_Grey_in_rock_shelter_square.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/70/thumb_Lindy_and_Grey_in_rock_shelter_square.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"A native Texan, I have cactus, big skies and vast horizons in my blood.

I can't separate poetry from painting, and this is the duality that brings to existence my bodies of work like Balance, Ice House and Garden of Wish.I have been drawn to the beauty of minimal but exact expression in the form of art and for me this is the way to say much, if not everything.","artist":{"email":"anibillhill@hotmail.com","id":293}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"47 Horace street","address2":"","city":"Dayton","first_name":"Laurent","last_name":"Arseneau","state":"Ohio","id":327,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/349/avatar2.JPG","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/349/preview_avatar2.JPG"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/349/thumb_avatar2.JPG"}}},"artist_statement":"Exploring natural beauty, decay and antiquity through paintings and sculpture...","artist":{"email":"larseneaujr@fastmail.net","id":349}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"128 Dubois Ave","address2":"","city":"Valley Stream","first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"Mezrahi","state":"New York","id":298,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/319/Jacob_Mezrahi_headshot.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/319/preview_Jacob_Mezrahi_headshot.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/319/thumb_Jacob_Mezrahi_headshot.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"b. 1980 in New York City, Mezrahi's paintings are inspired by all aspects of life.

Vic) began painting at the age of 5 under the instruction of her grandmother, and ever since, she has never stopped honing her craft.  For years, she has been a diligent participant of the drawing and painting workshops held by Rob Liberace.  She studied the traditional 19th century drawing with John Murdoch at the Gold Light Studio in New Hope, PA and classical drawing and painting at the Studio Incamminati  in Philadelphia, PA.  In her never-ending quest  for perfection,  Vic learned art conservation technics at SACI, Florence, Italy,  earned BA and MA in Art History from the George Washington and Rutgers Universities, and acquired a solid background in design. Nevertheless, she felt she was still missing some intangible, but crucial component of making art, some \"secret ingredient\" that was known to the Old Masters, but was often lacking in Modern Art.\r\n\r\nIn order to find out what that \"secret ingredient\" was, Vic set about studying firsthand the masterpieces of the renown art collections, and in the course of several years, she toured the Prado Museum in Madrid, The Louvre in Paris, the British Museum in London, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg,  the Pinakothek in Munich, and the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.  She spent countless hours copying the works of the Old Masters, analyzing their methods and techniques, and unlocking their secrets, until one day she knew she was ready to incorporate that vast knowledge into her own art.  Vic also thinks she has finally figured out what \"the missing ingredient\" was. While she continues to take every opportunity to further advance and refine her skill, she now knows that art is not only about the technique and skill.  It is just as much about our fleeting life.  And the beauty of it.  And our unique experiences of it.  \r\n\r\nVic explores a wide variety of subject matter and works in many genres using only the highest quality materials and well tested methods. \r\nShe currently resides in Princeton, NJ where she has her studio and actively participates in the local art shows and events. Her art is in private collections in US and abroad.","artist":{"email":"axodite@gmail.com","id":345}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"122 San Jose Ave. Apt. 6","address2":"","city":"Capitola","first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Ray","state":"California","id":338,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/360/IMG_0241.JPG","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/360/preview_IMG_0241.JPG"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/360/thumb_IMG_0241.JPG"}}},"artist_statement":"I use the stoke I get from being in the ocean and surfing to paint what feels closest to my heart.","artist":{"email":"kevinlyonray@gmail.com","id":360}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"1628 Oaklawn Court","address2":"","city":"Silver Spring","first_name":"Etian","last_name":"Huang","state":"MD","id":339,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/361/Watermelon_by_Etian_Huang.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/361/preview_Watermelon_by_Etian_Huang.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/361/thumb_Watermelon_by_Etian_Huang.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"I love painting and drawing since I was a little child.

He has been influenced by the Washington Color School and of the Color Field movement advanced by artists including Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, Gene Davis Clyfford Still, Leon Berkowitz and others. He is also drawn to the vibrant colors and heavy lines of Fauvists including Andre Derain and Henri Matisse. Jernigan appreciates contemporary abstract and impressionist artists including Joan Mitchell, Wolf Kahn, Angus Wilson and Tjasa Owen. He feels comfortable in both representative and abstract styles tending to focus on colorful landscapes and found-object collages. In addition, he takes a special interest in graphic illustrators from the 1960s and 1970s and those who emulate them - including Dick Bruna, Olle Eksell, Josh “SHAG” Agle, and Bianca Gomez. Jernigan works both large and small and pays special attention to commissioned works from art lovers. Most recently, he has embarked on an artistic collaboration with sculptor Geoffrey Gleason, painting Gleason’s abstract wooden sculptures. \r\n\r\nBryan was born in Little Rock, Arkansas and raised in Oklahoma where he was fortunate enough to behold colorful sunsets almost every evening unencumbered by buildings or mountains. His mother, an adept quilter, used to sit him down with her during long summers, and as she worked, he made patchworks of his own from colorful tissue he purchased at the local five and dime. After college in Oklahoma and Iowa, he moved to Washington, D.C. where he embraced the spirit of the urban landscape and was introduced to abstractionists from all over the world. He reconnected with his artistic past and began working on his renewed love of abstraction and impressionistic landscapes.\r\n\r\nJernigan’s work is included in corporate and private collections throughout the U.S. and Europe. \r\n\r\n“I believe people’s lives can be enriched by color. To see a person’s emotions change with the color he or she encounters is a powerful experience. If my work piques a viewer’s emotions, then I’ve achieved my goal.”\r\n\r\nMost recently, Jernigan has undertaken a set of works very close to his heart he calls “Forgotten:Remembered.” The series includes several paintings of barns and farms from his home state of Oklahoma that are either dilapidated or no longer in existence. From a series of photographs taken by his family members, he has reimagined these “backbones” of farm life in his signature colorful style as an homage to their importance, history and stalwartness on the Great Plains.","artist":{"email":"bryan@nafisdc.org","id":665}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"4611 4th Rd N","address2":"","city":"Arlington","first_name":"Anya","last_name":"Getter","state":"Virginia","id":622,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/662/agetter_riga.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/662/preview_agetter_riga.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/662/thumb_agetter_riga.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"Anya's influences and inspirations that brought out her artistic side began early in her life. Her grandfather was her first teacher as he would sketch and doodle funny drawings for her, and she tried to imitate him. When she was older, Anya and her childhood friends would make tiny sculptures from the clay mud on the banks of a nearby river. \r\n\r\nYet Anya's options to further explore her own talents and learn were limited. Having been born and raised in the Soviet Union, Anya had to chose a more practical path to pursue than the tumultuous world of art. While she had dreamed of attending an art school she choose instead to enter the world of Information Technology, but never lost her drive and passion for the craft. \r\nAfter immigrating to the United States, marrying her husband, establishing a career, and adding a dynamic duo of twins to her family, Anya felt the longing of her creative side wanting to be free. In the beginning, she began experimenting with imaginative decorations for children's jeans and denim overalls. This practice took off with the help of eBay and other mother's looking for unique outfits for their children. This allowed Anya to review her talents and the directions she wished to go in artistically.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Anya began more serious work as painter, exploring methods and techniques that communicated her vision. Since that time, Anya has continued her journey, joined the Arlington Artist Alliance, and has showed her work in many venues through the Washington, DC area.\r\n\r\nAmong the artists Anya cites influences from are Gustav Klimt, Mikhail, Vrubel, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Frida Kahlo. Anya is an avid reader and has always been drawn to a written word, so most of her inspirations come from quotes or poems. But lots of her works are also inspired by her friends and family.\r\n\r\nAnya paints in acrylics, using collage elements of paper, fabric, metal, yarn, foil and even dryer lint.\r\n\r\n","artist":{"email":"hippomama1@yahoo.com","id":670}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"17930 Mayerling St.","address2":"","city":"Granada Hills","first_name":"Zac","last_name":"Tomaszewski","state":"California","id":638,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/681/selfsquare.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/681/preview_selfsquare.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/681/thumb_selfsquare.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"","artist":{"email":"zactomaszewski@gmail.com","id":691}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"","address2":"","city":"Los Angeles","first_name":"A","last_name":"G","state":"California","id":626,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/668/IMG_4317.JPG","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/668/preview_IMG_4317.JPG"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/668/thumb_IMG_4317.JPG"}}},"artist_statement":"From the time I could write I was drawing and painting.

I see my art as a necessary outlet for my creative and intellectual energies; as such, my oil pastels and collages tend to be very primal, emotional works.

One is the spiritual connection the outdoors holds for me. I am enamored of the sights and sounds of nature: the patterns, the rhythms, the textures, and the almost tangible quality of the light.  The other is my enchantment with color.  It fascinates me that a certain hue can change depending upon how it is surrounded.  I love the richness of deep tones used together, the emotion of vivid explosions of color and the subtleties of combining softer hues, closely related in value.  Having worked for many years to describe the landscape, I have become increasingly interested in abstracting imagery and in pushing color in the direction of my choice.  I aspire to evoke the spirit of the landscape, simply by virtue of palette and mark making.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPASTEL\r\nThe very first time I tried pastel, it felt like coming home.  I was seduced by having a tray filled with gorgeous colors right at my fingertips. I loved the tactile nature of picking up what is essentially pure pigment and making a mark on the page, followed by another mark in response and then another.   Gradually the image would evolve.  The richness of the color and the immediacy of the process have kept me fully engaged with this amazing medium for many years. \r\n\r\nACRYLIC\r\nIn recent years, I have also been working with acrylics. There are limitless applications with this medium.  There are numerous textural additives that can be mixed into the paint or used to prime the surface.  The paint itself comes in a variety of viscosities ranging from heavy body, which can almost be sculpted, to fluid, which will flow easily without loss of vibrancy.  Acrylics can be transparent, opaque or iridescent and can be painted on a variety of substrates.  In addition to creating imagery which pays homage to nature, I want the surface itself to be compelling, interesting and beautifully painted.\r\n\r\nI am excited about the creative journey ahead and I believe as I move back and forth between these two wonderful worlds, each body of work will be informed by the other.\r\n","artist":{"email":"teresa.mccue@comcast.net","id":713}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"5503 Santa Anita Avenue","address2":"","city":"Temple City","first_name":"Kruti","last_name":"Shah","state":"California","id":648,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/693/Image_4_Dare_to_be_different_I.JPG","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/693/preview_Image_4_Dare_to_be_different_I.JPG"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/693/thumb_Image_4_Dare_to_be_different_I.JPG"}}},"artist_statement":"I enjoy the complex interplay between lines and patterns that create intuitive abstractions and nature inspired creations.

The teachers, students, and parents, that is. My fascination with colored pencils is often questioned by many. Colored pencils are viewed as relatively simple drawing utensils used by occupied parents to distract their children. Perhaps it is my inner childlike nature which increases my attraction towards such supposedly trivial objects, yet I am not ashamed of my overzealousness when presented with new pencils. A vast array of freshly sharpened pencils only serves to fuel my ardent desire to create art. Such fine tuned instruments ensure the utmost precision to create a balanced equilibrium between artistic expression and basic application. The vibrant pigments combined with the rich, waxy layers of the colored pencils merge together to form an image which redefines the traditional notion of aesthetic appeal.\r\nAs a young child, I was not particularly fond of the arts. I dabbled in the occasional tracing of a book cover here and there, but I never diverted such attention to drawing as I do now. My love for drawing was not immediate, but rather a result of constant work and intense perseverance. My first picture was created at the age of twelve, during which I was left home alone, and quite frankly, had nothing better to do. To my surprise, the picture had turned out rather well for someone who seldom partook in the arts. From that moment onwards, I began drawing daily, copying drawings from magazines and books in hopes of creating a satisfactory work.\r\nInitially, my works were harshly scrutinized, my methods rejected, and my dreams dismissed. Everything I did was considered backwards. I drew the eyes before the face, finished the hair before I started the background, colored in circles rather than in straight lines, admired Bouguereau before Dalí, and most importantly, used colored pencils rather than paints. In spite of all of the negativity surrounding my artistic pursuits, I refused to yield to the shrill voices of my critics. I studied art textbooks, familiarized myself with prominent artists, and read tutorials to enhance my overall knowledge about the art field. Art was no longer a hobby, but a passion. I aimed to make an impact on the world, whether it was small or large.\r\n","artist":{"email":"veronica81995@aol.com","id":764}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"","address2":"","city":"Chicago","first_name":"Diane","last_name":"Green","state":"IL","id":717,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/772/DianeArtist3.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/772/preview_DianeArtist3.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/772/thumb_DianeArtist3.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"Diane Green was born in Memphis Tennessee.

It's very fun and peaceful out here--exactly what I needed.  I feel incredibly lucky that my friend offered it to me.  \r\n\r\nI grew up in St. Louis, living the dream, playing freeze tag and wiffleball with the kids on my street, working on art and reading under trees, dreaming about discovering new places and pirate treasure.  \r\n\r\nMy Dad was a great, funny guy, and a talented artist, and he passed away this past year. My parents always took me to the art museum, the science center and the library in St. Louis.  I've been thinking about how we become who we are, how our experiences and dreams shape our personality and heart.  I'm hoping that I can do something positive with my art, helping the world in some way.  I'm working on a children's book and several other things.  I appreciate every kindness and opportunity I've been given.\r\n\r\nI'm very worried about the environment, and I would love to be able to help animals and the planet on a larger scale someday.   Another dream, perhaps a bit more selfish, is to take art classes all over the world--sculpture, painting, jewelry, photography, drawing--everything!  My Dad always shared his National Geographic magazines, books and maps with me, helped me with drawing and construction, and encouraged me to work hard, be strong, do what I love and be happy.  I feel that most people are hungry for a life full of meaning, integrity and beauty.  \r\n\r\nI've moved around quite a bit for college, graduate school and AmeriCorps, and now I have a little time and freedom to breathe, to think, to work.  At night, I stand under a gorgeous sky full of stars, and most mornings I work in the organic garden.   My sweet, crazy, frighteningly smart and athletic rescue dog reminds me every day of what's really important in life.

What drew me to this work was its sense of improvisation, high energy, and an emphasis on the painting process.  Instead of using paint to carry out a visual idea, I was thrilled to discover the visual idea through the process of creating it.\r\n\r\nThe iconography in my work comes from a lifetime of personal and cultural experience.  As a young girl in the 1950s, I resented the limited role assigned to women, and sought to break away from it.  I emulated my three older brothers, and wanted to act in this world of men by accomplishing significant things.  I eschewed “women’s work,” and therefore didn’t learn the joy of cooking until I had left home and was forced to cook for myself.\r\n\r\nI used strong colors and forceful gestures in my painting, avoiding any effect that might be deemed “feminine.”  I took it as a compliment when someone said to me once, “You paint like a man.”  It was only years later, as I matured, that I could embrace the delicate, the patterned, and even pastel colors in my art. \r\n \r\nTwo signs that are integral to my work are the circle and the X.  Through the circular shapes and lines on my canvases, I embrace the feminine.  While I still prefer to wear loose clothing that does not reveal my own body’s curves, I do enjoy filling my art with circles and eggs in abundance.\r\n\r\nAs for the Xs in my paintings, sometimes making one is an act of  \"crossing-out\" what has come before.  Making an X is a way of saying \"no\" to the world.  In a way, X's are the opposite of O's, and mixing them expresses my ambivalence.  X is a primitive kind of mark that may come from the unconscious, a kind of making your mark or staking out your territory. X accumulates meanings.\r\n\r\nThere is also a physical satisfaction in making an X, especially a large one that fills up a canvas.  It feels decisive to make this strong mark.  At other times, the X is simply playful.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a young girl, my grandmother spent hours trying to teach me how to make paper flowers.  She was a true artist, but I resisted this “women’s craft,” and grew bored.  My mother loved flowers, and always planted a garden of them, but I, again, resisted this path.  It was only later in life that floral and leaf designs showed up in my art.\r\n\r\nAs my personal history and culture are my life’s foundation, each layer I paint on a canvas becomes the history of its surface.  These layers accumulate and influence, yet not always overtly.  Like sediment, they build.  By mixing the acrylic paint with water and gloss medium to make a thin wash, the translucent quality of top layers reveal aspects of the painting’s history.  At other times, a thick impasto hides the past.  Yet it is there beneath the surface and has had its influence nonetheless. \r\n","artist":{"email":"lynne@artbylt.com","id":899}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"325 E. 4th Street","address2":"Suite 2","city":"Loveland","first_name":"Angela","last_name":"Canada Hopkins","state":"Colorado","id":819,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/886/140x140_pixels.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/886/preview_140x140_pixels.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/886/thumb_140x140_pixels.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"I live in Loveland, Colorado, and I'm passionate about art, science, and the intersection of the two. \r\n\r\nOther fun facts:  I teach yoga.

Art has played a big part in my life since early childhood and I have been drawing and painting for many years.  My inner passion for art was fueled by an inspirational high school art teacher who gave me the confidence to keep moving forward and experiment with my creativity.  I spent most of my young adult life in central Florida where I was inspired by tropical or coastal landscapes, but now that I’m living in the Midwest I find my inspirations changing to fit my new surroundings.  Aside from traditional paintings, I love creating silly children’s art and fun cartoon like pop art pieces.  When I step back and laugh out loud at a work in progress, I know that I am accomplishing my goal.  Evoking laughter leaves me feeling great, and I strive to create the same reaction for all who encounter them!\r\n\r\nMy favorite medium is acrylic because it is versatile and easy to work with.  I enjoy painting on canvas and wood with brushes and palette knives.  Using different tools and supplies gives me a feeling of adventure and freedom and helps promote creativity.\r\n\r\nThe goal with my floral and nature based work is to celebrate the different seasons by capturing a variety of scenes and landscapes that caused me to stop and appreciate their beauty.

Over the years I’ve noticed that it is easy to miss the little pleasures all around us when life gets busy.

Abstract expressions on canvas are all about color, freedom and problem solving. I thoroughly enjoy the abstract structure of all paintings. To me, the beginning structure is the most exciting part. Starting with one color, working my way to another, and ending with just the right note is a very satisfying, self-centered experience that I enjoy frequently. No other activity gives the fulfillment that abstract painting does. It is a tight rope of never ending excitement.\r\n\r\nPamela Gatens is an artist in the abstract/impressionist style who finds her inspiration in color. Working in acrylic and watercolor, she is a prolific painter and entertaining teacher. She began her artistic career at a small newspaper in Dallas, Texas setting type and composing ad layouts. Pamela continued working in the graphic art and design industry in various settings including an almost 20-year ownership of a graphic design business in California with her husband, Pat. Gatens is a member of Greenbrier Artists of Carnegie Hall and is a Signature Member of the West Virginia Watercolor Society.

The subjects range from faces and figures of women and children to landscapes, nature scenes and abstracts.\r\n\r\nAll the pieces begin with fabric and paper collage arranged, sewn and adhered to wood panels. The collages consist of any of the following; antique cloths, contemporary fabrics, antique dictionary pages, old children’s school books, atlases, architectural plans, wallpaper, tablecloths, napkins, lace, buttons, flowers, leaves and any variety of papers and 2D found objects. Over the collages, the drawings are done in charcoal and the work is painted with acrylics and mediums.\r\n\r\n“The joy in this process of collaging, drawing and painting is the instinctual choices of rendering and harmonizing what I will cover up and what I will leave to be revealed.”\r\n\r\n“My intention is to weave an autobiographical tapestry invoking and addressing universal issues such as philosophy, spirituality, sexuality, motherhood and self-awareness.

Underprivileged and caroming through the So. California area as the first-born in a multi-fractured family,  creativity, resilience, and imagination was essential to my self-preservation. At a young age preservation morphed into expression by way of art. The first time I saw how art had the potential to move people, I recalled getting into big trouble in the second grade by the principle of the school for drawing old war ships and cartoons instead of paying attention to the lesson plan. In my case it seemed, moved people in the wrong way. I hid my talent from everyone until three years after my second grade incident. I received my first positive stroke for my art when I drew a woodpecker from a popular Saturday morning cartoon and a friend took notice. Today my passion for art is influenced by many things. I transform music, mood of my environment, experiences and relationships into a visual expression.\r\n\r\nTwenty years of personal and professional evolution, has become a revolution propelled by a paralyzing motorcycling accident (a near death experience). Even now through multiple surgeries, rehab and limited use of my right side, I now use my left hand to create.

Originally from Washington, North Carolina, she relocated to Portland, Oregon approximately ten years ago, awed by the amazing beauty of the Pacific Northwest.\r\n\r\nWinfield derives inspiration from the elements of the environment and from nature, including many unique aspects; weather, rusting metal, aging wood, water, dilapidated buildings, peeling paint, stones and rocks, the city lights at night. She notices magic everywhere, often in unanticipated places; from the surface of a body of water to the rustic, industrial warehouse floor of a manufacturing facility. The creative process for Winfield involves experimenting with various mediums and methods of infusing texture, iridescence and illumination into her work. Winfield’s art is internationally collected and lends a refreshing and energizing vitality while simultaneously portraying great depth and balance.\r\n\r\nThe American Art Awards have honored Winfield with the award of 1st place in the Abstract Art category during 2011 and 2012.

I align the process of creating art with a spiritual practice, drawing on inner experiences and meditations. Navigating the seen and the unseen, the work explores how the earth plane and the higher, inner worlds blend with each other and complete each other. It is a process of uncovering, of revealing something which existed previously only in an inner world. The aim is to record a state higher than I currently reside in, with a relative permanence. Through this process I create a document which contains not only a record of an experience, but also the lingering fragrance of an impermanent consciousness. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBio:\r\n\r\nAhavani Mullen is an artist who in recent years has been creating works using encaustic paint, an ancient medium composed of pigmented beeswax and resin.

I'm most interested in tapping into the desire of individuals to tell their story and listen to the stories of others. The narrative for my art is drawn from conversations, my own experiences, my previous work with girls within the Family Court System and the advice I wish I had the wherewithal to stream into words when it really needs to be heard. I blend these narratives into written short stories from which I create  multi panel drawings in graphic novel format and dimensional collages that are snapshots of the main character at the heart of the storyline.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI create works by interweaving pen and ink, pastel, watercolor pencil, recycled painted images, preprinted materials and fabric.  My method is to meld together various marks, textures and line qualities that have a confident direction with the illusion of great depth of field and a surface that is energized and structured.  The perspective in my art is purposefully wonky with visually important forms teetering on top of a solid more grounded shape giving it an edgy anxious feel. This balancing act of artistic elements moves me towards realizing that snap in space that happens when you successfully move the viewer from seeing 2-dimensional space into believing it is 3-dimensional space even if the trees in the forest are made from purple paper music notes. \r\n\r\nMy favorite tools are a Uni-ball fine line ink pen, graphite and pastel sticks, watercolor paper, acid free adhesives and a Mars plastic eraser. I can make anything with this small collection of tools; I feel confident using them. I can be decisive, analytical, express myself in words and images, be dimensional, change my mind, tear it apart and glue it back together in a different way. \r\nINFLUENCES\r\nMany factors influenced my artistic style. My line quality and color palette is heavily tainted by early Warner Brother's animation and I know that my love of the perspective smack of drawings is drawn from the hours I've spent playing with pop-up books while working at the Nelson Museum bookstore back in the early 90's.. \r\n\r\nOther artistic influences in random order include: the Caldacott Medal winning illustrations I saw during the weekly readings of my elementary school librarian, my grandmother’s junk/treasure drawer, the radio show “This American Life,” object collections in small town cultural and history museums, and artists Edward Gorey, Shell Silverstein, Dr. Seuss, Joseph Cornell, Eva Hess, Wayne Thiebaud and Hundertwasser. \r\n\r\nResume available upon request","artist":{"email":"art@michelefritz.com","id":1329}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"932 N Shaver St.","address2":"","city":"Portland","first_name":"Erin","last_name":"Galvez","state":"Oregon","id":678,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/727/profile.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/727/preview_profile.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/727/thumb_profile.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"My current work in acrylics is an exploration of abstraction.\r\n\r\n“I still find it remarkable that the small details that have influenced my life continue to find their way into my work.

Its a necessity, like eating and breathing. Art has always been an important part of who I am.

I quit trying to paint perfect pictures. I instead chose to focus more on the feeling of the painting, letting  brush strokes show, or even be the focus. Many of my paintings now start with no particular end in mind, just a need to paint, to get thought out of my head so they don't clutter my mind. When I ran out of wall space I decided to put myself out to the world as an artist, to stop seeing my dream of being an artist as fool-hearted.

I took interest in art at birth, but like many I did not receive a sense of depth, color, or perspective until a later age. After learning most of my basics in junior high I turned to spray can art, which many relate to as, “Graffiti”.  Life as a graffiti artist was a real thriller to me. I loved the pressure it put on me, and challenge to get it done quickly without being caught by law enforcement. All in all, it added a whole other skill level to my art abilities. Most frown upon these actions, but many do not understand why we are left to do it this way? The answer? It was a way for me to achieve a skill level no regular artist can even fathom of accomplishing, and a way to escape from society at the same time expressing my feelings with society without them knowing who I am. When I did master large-scale art, and I transitioned to a piece of paper, or canvas it all came very simple to me.\r\n    I have learned various medias over the past thirteen years, and one media has been trailing me the past 5 years, and most people know it as, “Airbrushing”, it has really opened a new vision in the art world for me, it could be the fact that I can use a tiny spraying mechanism to create such clean art, or that I do not have to carry every color I need to complete an art piece in a separate spray can. Airbrushing the last five years I have performed many jobs for people such as, clothing, signs, vehicles, helmets, motorcycles, and wall art. Overall, whether I am drawing, charcoal, pastel, acrylic, spray painting, or airbrushing I am very consistent in every media I do.\r\n    Aside from the hands on art learning I have accomplished through my life I have been educated as well through general studies, and some college classes. I am always exploring new ways to express, new knowledge of other artists, and new things to paint. This is what has brought me to show case my art in galleries now. Education is key, believe it or not in the art society.","artist":{"email":"perezc002@me.com","id":1360}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"391 Tampa Avenue","address2":"","city":"Pittsburgh","first_name":"Chris N","last_name":"Rohrbach","state":"PA","id":1207,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1207/signatureweb_copy.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1207/preview_signatureweb_copy.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1207/thumb_signatureweb_copy.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"Creating drawings that establish harmonious arrangements of tonal values, shapes, textures, and repetitious directions based on my subject matter is my goal as an artist.

She received a Bachelor of Arts in Art Education from St. Aquinas College, Sparkill, New York.\r\n\r\nThroughout adulthood, Jen often worked in various mediums, including photography and ceramics, as well as painting. At this time, her art remained a hobby as she was busy raising three daughters.\r\n\r\nFollowing a traumatic closed head injury, Jen began to paint as a therapeutic means to stimulate brain activity. She loved the feel of the paints and canvas beneath her fingers as she “connected” with her work in a very real sense. Many of her works were created using her fingers and hands rather than brushes. She prefers this method when the subject matter and medium allows;  it is very instinctual and “free”.  Her paintings contain brilliant vivid color, and expressive form and movement.\r\n\r\n“I have learned from painting that painting expresses feeling, and I want  my viewers to be able to ‘react’, to feel something, when viewing my work. Not to just view a pretty picture. Unless that pretty picture makes them happy whenever they look at it; that’s a reaction!”\r\n\r\n“I paint the way I see things, and how I feel regarding various personal as well as global events. Since mainly my vision was affected by my stroke, I don't have normal vision any more, and would not be able to reproduce an image as it actually exists. I feel that this 'disability' has served me well; as it allows me to be truly self-expressive.”\r\n\r\nRecently her work has exploded, reaching new levels. By working with tar, and/or wax, she has created a dramatic surface with the subject matter becoming more abstract/ contemporary.”I often begin a new painting with no particular direction in mind. I paint to music, and let the music move me. I creatively apply paint and then 'see' my direction. I love the spontaneity of this method. It gives me back some of the freedom I have lost as a result of my disability.\r\n","artist":{"email":"dacota827@gmail.com","id":1370}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"7600 Winters Chapel Rd.","address2":"","city":"Atlanta","first_name":"Sherri","last_name":"Richards","state":"Georgia","id":1266,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1266/Italian_Vacation_018.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1266/preview_Italian_Vacation_018.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1266/thumb_Italian_Vacation_018.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"I have been drawing since I was five.

Lately, I make my bread and butter doing animal portraits as people are truly (myself included) in love with their pets.  I'm excited to have a studio this year in one of our art districts.  I hope you'll enjoy browsing my sight and feel free to visit as often as you'd like.","artist":{"email":"info@sherrisart.com","id":1395}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"2535 NE 61st AVE","address2":"","city":"Portland","first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Lockhart","state":"Oregon","id":1269,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1269/20131229_190147.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1269/preview_20131229_190147.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1269/thumb_20131229_190147.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"      Ever since I was young, I've expressed myself through different forms of art, from  pencil, pen and ink, and watercolors.

Beginning as a child with the certainty that she was an artist and it would be her lifelong path. She took every art course she could through her community and school and realized she still needed formal study. This seeking of knowledge took her through six colleges and universities studying Fine Art, Commercial Art,and Advertising Design. She graduated Cum Laude with a Bachelors of Fine Art Degree and a secondary teaching certificate from Westminster College in Salt Lake City, Utah. In college she had received several scholarships and had the opportunity to study Classical Oil Painting under the tutelage of the famous American, western artist, Don Doxey. She finally had her formal foundation in art!\r\nAfter college Glore continued studying, taking workshops from many top artists, including Irving Shapiro, Frank Web, Bill Condit, Betty DeMaree, Zolten Zabo and Don Andrews. She took classes and watched demonstrations at the Art Students League of Denver, studying with or observing, Quang Ho, Kim English and Ramon Kelley. She studied Figure Drawing as a teenager and continues to paint from live models at the studio of Melinda Morrison. She also takes and teaches workshops whenever possible. She is a member of the Foothills Art Center, the Evergreen Artists Association, and the Plein Air Artists of Colorado.\r\nGlore has packed her brushes and paints to study first-hand this earth and all her people.  Her exotic travels and paintings include some of the most remote corners of the earth, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Fiji, Tahiti, Solomon Islands, Philippines, Irian Jaya, Africa, Morocco, Thailand, Turkey, Mexico, Guatemala, and all over Europe. Her series of indigenous people has won her many awards, including a first place in the “Eight State Art Zone” show at the Jewish Community Center of Denver. The painting “Huli Warrior” was juried into the prestigious “Rocky Mountain National Show” in Golden, Colorado. Her work has been accepted into the Colorado State Watermedia Show in l992,93,94,95 (Second Place Award),96, 2011 & 2013. She was invited to participate in the “Alluring Exhibit” at the \"Loveland Museum\" in Colorado in l992. She also had a solo show at the “Worldly Collections” gallery in Aspen, Colorado in l991. Her work was featured on the cover of the Weekend edition of the Denver Post in l995.\r\nGlore lived in the coastal town of Marbella, Spain for fifteen years where she taught art classes and workshops. While there she started the first American style Art Festival--www.artemarbella.com -- now in its 5th year. During her time in Spain she was asked to exhibit in numerous solo and group exhibitions, and was in several galleries including the “Van Gestel Galary, the \"Galaria El Corte Ingles,” the \"British & International Art Gallery,” and the “Con Tinta Roja.”  \r\nShe lived in Aix-en Provence, France for a year and a half where she painted daily in the footsteps of Ceyzanne, Degas, and Van Gogh. In Southern France she produced some of her finest masterpieces.\r\n\r\nThe beauty and romance of Southern Spain and France has now infused into her work. Using a brush or palette knife, she paints layers of color, which brings the palate of nature alive to vibrate and mesmerize her paintings. This is the true method of the impressionists as was taught at the “Cape Cod School of Light” by Henri Henchi. Glore learned this method twenty years ago in Florida. Living in Denver when not traveling, she paints our beautiful American West in both watercolors and oils. She also teaches art classes from her studio.  Her work can be seen in “The Great American West Gallery” in downtown Denver.\r\n","artist":{"email":"pixiespaintbrush@yahoo.com","id":1645}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"81782 Lost Valley Lane","address2":"","city":"Dexter","first_name":"Gail","last_name":"Heffron","state":"OR","id":1295,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1295/image.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1295/preview_image.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1295/thumb_image.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"As an Impressionist Artist, I was inspired by the original Impressionists while studying Art History.

Fascinated by the world around him, color and sound proved to be the two things that moved him most. At the age of 13, Reinder began studying and playing guitar, eventually moving to Amsterdam at age 19 to attend the Conservatory of Amsterdam, where he graduated in 2007. When asked about his songwriting techniques, he would often be found describing how each song had a color, which he then turned into words and melodies.\r\n\r\nIn Summer 2011, after a visit to the van Gogh museum in Amsterdam, Reinder felt it was time to release some of his ideas about color onto a canvas. \r\nReinder is a self-taught artist, an admirer of abstract expressionists, CoBrA and impressionists. His work is expressive and abundantly colorful, playfully challenging the imagination. He does not adhere to any rules of the medium, for he has not been taught them. This allows his work to contain a raw stream of unconscious shapes and colors to run directly from his imagination to the brush.\r\n\r\nReinder currently lives and works as an artist in New York City.\r\n\r\nFor more information please visit the artist’s website: www.reinderoldenburger.com\r\n\r\n\t","artist":{"email":"reinderoldenburger@gmail.com","id":532}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"3815 Evergreen Lane","address2":"","city":"Columbia","first_name":"Adya","last_name":"Crawford","state":"MISSOURI","id":1319,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1319/italy250.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1319/preview_italy250.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1319/thumb_italy250.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"Adya Crawford is a professional artist- tattoo artist by day and painter by night.

Elizabeth has found that painting can be an arduous yet worthwhile mental process. She is inspired by simply seeing a certain color combination and with urgency begins a piece. From there she truly does not know where it will end up; during the weeks of working on each piece, as her emotions go up and down and ebb and flow; everything becomes twisted inside her head for a certain period of time and she goes from extremely frustrated to highly elated; at which point she finally knows the painting is complete and she is never happier than in that specific moment.

I am prolific and unrelenting, fearless and determined.  I am on a mission to complete as many paintings as I have inside of me before, God forbid, I can’t anymore.  I am of the ‘kitchen sink’ school of art – whatever works - and if it doesn’t, wash it off or cover it up.  “Work it til it works” as a friend once said.\r\n  I paint things that grow.  I am moved by nature unspoiled. I don’t do art to make the grand statement.  My subjects are usually the ordinaries – roadside weeds, leaves in the water, scraggly trees.  I seek to celebrate the ordinary and glorify the familiar, to make the simple profound.   One of the blessings about being an artist is that I get to translate the beauty that I visualize.  Our society is often moving so fast, that the casual observer is unable to freeze the gorgeous moments.  If my paintings can reflect a mood or a memory – the warmth of the sun, the smell of the earth, the quiet of an early morning, then perhaps I can help people find a sense of peace and pleasure, however fleeting.    I enjoy experimenting with various surfaces and media, although watercolor is my favorite.  Often I begin a painting by throwing on loose washes of color and letting the uncontrolled paint lead the way.  Then I begin to work back into it, pushing and pulling, as realistic images emerge.  Some are spontaneous.  Some are ‘late-bloomers’ and develop more slowly.  Each painting takes on a life and spirit of its own.   They become my many children, and I find it quite difficult to part with some of them.  \r\n  \r\n","artist":{"email":"sbennett1949@msn.com","id":154}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"254 Oakridge Drive","address2":"","city":"Springfield","first_name":"Kathleen","last_name":"Fallucca","state":"OH","id":160,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/172/Copy_of_IMG_0256.JPG","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/172/preview_Copy_of_IMG_0256.JPG"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/172/thumb_Copy_of_IMG_0256.JPG"}}},"artist_statement":"My original inspiration came from growing up spending time with a friend whose parents had a gallery in Old Town, Chicago.

I try to elevate the ordinary to become extraordinary through the use of color, texture and my beloved realistic detail. I do portraits, pets, animals, still lifes, landscapes and accept commissions.\r\nLately I have been working mainly in scratchboard pushing that medium to do things it shouldn't be able to do. I particularly love the minute details that I can achieve in scratchboard sometimes even using a magnifying glass so I can see what I am doing.

Most of my pieces have a natural expression which is representational of the manner of which I produce them. I cannot help but be captivated by the creative beauty around us- which we can see every day: in the landscapes, the trees, the birds, the people, and the sky. All of these aspects derive the energy from the deep romances of nature around us and encourage me as I paint. Just as the Great Spirit has instilled a unique drive within each of us, each painting reveals a spirit that varies from each observer to the other. That is what makes these paintings unique- they allow freedom of imagination to the viewer and remind us that striving for flawlessness essentially limits ourselves. Instead we must see flaws as their own perfection. So that we may learn to embrace the rare pieces in our lives, for they are what will truly express ourselves and set us apart from the conventional.

I’ve worked in many mediums in art, yet it is in burning and inking as well as charcoal that I find I cannot leave and always I come back. It is just fascinating to watch an image materialize upon paper or wood as you apply heat. There is also the finite feeling that you cannot fix what is done. What is burned is now forever. It makes the work fragile as literally the paper is now weaker. What I love too, is there is really only one color, or spectrum of color to work in. Brown, to degrees. And I love brown, so there is no bore to the limit of colors. And when I work in ink and charcoal I am amazed to watch the colors appear. And it is careful work, for in ink you cannot make a mistake and charcoal is often delicate and quick to ruin. I guess it is these qualities of burning, inking and using charcoal that I love, they require love and gentleness, and if done with care I cannot hate what I create.\r\nAnd yes, what you see is my imagination at work. And it is all about mushrooms in their greatest glory and wonder. I actually don’t love the taste of mushrooms, at least some of them, they just fascinate me in their oddity.

The women baptize themselves in a patient painting process, each becoming more completely herself, more completely individual as she is colored. \r\n\r\nI have a painting practice which is performative and ritualistic. My painter friend Geddes and I have performed a monthly painting conversation: we sit facing each other, surrounded by paints and water buckets, piles of white paper and colored scraps. We each paint twelve paintings over the course of twelve hours: Geddes paints for an hour, then sets her painting before me. I respond to her painting with a painting of my own, and then deliver my response to her, etc. The process helps us work through ideas, free images from our glutted subconscious, re-combine images and ideas in permutation after permutation, communicate with and pay attention to each other in a language un-stymied by social convention, patterns of speech, and linear thinking. We each have hundreds of one-hour paintings piled in our rooms, paintings that are both seeds for new works (the project is a performance designed to generate other performances) and evidence of a meaningful painting ritual. \r\n\r\nWe have expanded this conversational painting practice by inviting other artists to paint with us. We learn about their techniques, their subject matter, their various approaches to setting up their supplies, they ways they conceive of an artwork, the music they listen to, the things they talk about while they paint, etc.\r\n\r\n","artist":{"email":"annieblazejack@gmail.com","id":424}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"6939 Park Mesa Way, Unit 115","address2":"","city":"San Diego","first_name":"Mary Lea","last_name":"Bradley","state":"California","id":407,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/430/tp077B.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/430/preview_tp077B.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/430/thumb_tp077B.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"American abstract artist Mary Lea Bradley is a self taught artist from Southern California.

She balances modes of painting realistically and painting in an impressionist style, taking the attributes of both and applying them to her subject matter. Her sources are rooted in the natural world, interpreted through her unique lens of keen observation.  Having also worked for 12 years as a medical imager, she honed these observational skills for visual precision. Cerra’s work uses light and composition to engage the viewer, allowing their brief escape into the experience from which the painting is derived. \r\n\r\nShortly after graduating from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and Tufts University with a BFA, Patti opened a gallery with a partner in Hartland, Vermont. Her work was comprised of monoprints and raku vessels which she exhibited at various venues around the state, as well as at galleries in Massachusetts for over ten years. At that time she also created a line of raku-fired jewelry that was represented and sold nationally. Her experience in the arts as a maker and exhibitor provides the platform for the rich studio practice that she maintains today. Cerra lives and works in Norwich, Vermont.\r\n\r\n\"As I negotiate down this path as an artist, I'm hoping to create a bridge between my paintings, the planet we live on, and the viewer.

I love the surprise!\r\n \r\n I love to play with composition and color, always refining, changing and creating as I work my way through a piece.

I create from both intuition and from the energy and inspiration that I absorb from the world around me.\r\n \r\nI find myself in control of certain aspects, but completely out of control of others.

It means something different to each person that sees it.\r\n \r\nI always hope the viewer enjoys my work as much as I enjoy creating it.

He creates visual expressions to inspire and connect people, initiate dialog, and promote awareness and interaction for all.  His work explores awareness of the interconnected reality we all live in, opening hearts and minds to an increasing level of understanding. \r\n\r\n“I endeavor to create images that are visually interesting yet contain a certain level of mystery“. Michael’s goal is to involve the viewer on multiple levels, encouraging an interaction with the work mentally, emotionally and spiritually. “All of my pieces are autobiographical to some extent… what I feel is what is expressed, sometimes they are conscious feelings, usually they source from a sub-conscious level“. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, Michael’s work has taken on a decidedly spiritual turn. “Through my work I’ve come to the realization that creativity is a spiritual attribute, I feel a spiritual connection with work, both in the process of creation and in connecting with others.”\r\n\r\nMichael is currently developing new work in two distinct areas: 1) altars created from found materials such as antique drop leaf table parts (and painted imagery on the surface), and 2) either an installation or individual pieces that will identify and highlight belief system commonalities, which will be communicated through the literal use of threads that will connect and tie together religious and spiritual scriptures, quotes, and imagery from various faith groups. His goal is to creatively showcase the common threads of spirituality shared by the world’s major belief systems. Michael is also currently working with the Interfaith Council of Southwest Connecticut for their feedback and suggestions, as well as with a member of the Interfaith Council of Orange County California to ensure various viewpoints are represented and that nothing disrespectful is shown.","artist":{"email":"artistmichaelbond@gmail.com","id":664}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"","address2":"","city":"Baltimre","first_name":"Ania ","last_name":"Milo","state":"Maryland","id":625,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/667/Ania_Promo_1.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/667/preview_Ania_Promo_1.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/667/thumb_Ania_Promo_1.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"Ania Milo emerged onto the art scene in early 2010 and making her own unique style of art with her passionate, expressive, and raw energy, she quickly found many admirers of her work. Milo’s art is transformative and transmutative as she uses her own multifaceted emotions to create works that reach to the depths of the souls of those who view them.\r\nArt for Ania is a personal journey of wholeness, self-discovery, and spiritual fulfillment because through her artwork she continues to discover her authentic self and as she states: “creating art is a way of finding out who I am.” Which has not been an easy thing for this sensitive and creative woman to figure out. \r\n\r\nBorn and raised in Krakow, Poland behind the Iron Curtain of Communism until the age of 13, Ania always felt the great divide between the luxurious, colorful and rich beauty of her native culture and the imposed “sameness” and dullness of the oppressive Communist Regime. She often escaped the dreariness of her very-day life to Krakow’s Old Town Art District, where she wondered the halls of spectacular churches and galleries and looked upon paintings like the painting by famous Polish painter Władysław Podkowiński (1866-1895), and his oil on canvas painting (1894) “Szał Uniesień” (Ecstasy) \r\n\r\nThe inspiration for Ania’s paintings comes from various sources. Mostly from within, based on her own thoughts and feelings, but music, dreams, or an engaging conversation, can trigger an image in her mind’s eye that will urge her to allow it to come into existence. Ania says that before she can start painting the images hidden inside her compel her to bring them to life and fueled by this urgency, color explodes onto the canvas and in that moment she experiences a deep spiritual awakening. “My soul is set free into a world where anything is possible and no boundaries exist. As I continue to work, I do not always see what the finished painting will look like, but I sense it, I feel it, I know it. It builds and develops in front of my eyes. I create it. I give it life.” \r\n\r\nAnia not only paint abstracts, but also express her love and admiration for animals by creating unique, whimsical and delightful animal portraits. Her connection with each and every animal she paints is evident in all her finished portraits. She infuses every animal with it’s own life-force and when you look into their eyes, you can see into their soul.\r\n\r\n","artist":{"email":"aniammilo@gmail.com","id":672}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"175 scenic pass","address2":"","city":"Fayetteville","first_name":"Olga","last_name":"Mosina (Wildman)","state":"GA","id":630,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/672/Photo.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/672/preview_Photo.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/672/thumb_Photo.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"Olga Mosina (Wildman) was born in Moscow, Russia.

I wake up thinking in color and gesture and lines wriggle up my spine.

Regardless of the medium they all begin with a simple compositional idea that acts as the springboard from which the work evolves.\r\n\r\nIn the recent drawings I have been working with grids, a series of overlaid intervals and chance operations created both virtually and physically. With most of the drawings, which in turn extends to the paintings and motion pieces, there is an internal logic that the viewer can decipher with time. For example, in some of the drawings the horizontal intervals are repeated in some fashion on the vertical axis. These simple compositional ideas become the bedrock for the gestural activity.\r\n\r\nWith this new body of paintings and animations I am exploring the same ideas as the drawings. When the verticals appear in some of the works they reveal the internal structure of the horizontal intervals, even ones that are buried in layers of digital information or actual paint.\r\n\r\nAll the work starts with a simple compositional structure that acts as the container for “painterly incident” or the action of the painting—painting in the broadest sense including the photo pieces and animations. Some passages accept this structure others try to subvert it. There is an intentional play between the logic of the geometric structure and a more intuitive painterly surface. These opposing forces give the work its depth, visual interest and emotional resonance.\r\n\r\nI have no interest in making aesthetically pleasing works, how the work is experienced by a viewer and the relationship that is created is what is important to me. This is the reason I have chosen not to use descriptive titles which would perhaps detract from the viewer’s own unique personal relationship with the work. With DD061210 I was thinking about and referencing Renaissance landscape painting but I do not really feel it necessary to reveal this to a viewer, if one senses this influence that is wonderful, if not, the viewer’s own individual interpretation is equally valid.\r\n\r\nIt has become a bit of an artistic cliché to say that one doesn’t know what one os doing while creating artwork, but there is some truth to that statement.

One of my professors once said that I work intuitively.  That is really the best way to describe my technique. I paint to express thoughts and emotions that I don’t have the words to explain.  I enjoy paint—whether it is oil, acrylic, watercolor, latex, or egg tempera—they each have their own specific characteristics which I can experiment with and manipulate.  Each medium has its own personality.  Oil is rich and luscious.  Acrylic is harsh and bold.  Latex is flat, opaque, and fluent.  Egg tempera is translucent, glossy, and vibrant. \r\n\r\nThe act of painting, to me, is like conflict and resolution.  The blank canvas is the conflict.  I put marks down, and continue to respond to them until I consider the piece to be resolved.  It is a conversation in paint.  The conflict in my work is echoed from a number of sources of anxiety in my own life.  I am constantly struggling to find order between art and science, order and chaos, love and hate, contentment and depression, confusion and clarity, independence and dependence.

And even if you are not deep, you can still take it lightly. All that is required is a sense of humor. Liz London's artwork explores shifting and illusive paradox between the inner and the outer worlds, the deepest paradoxes and depths of her own inner transformation by identifying and creating her own personal archetypes, historical and mythological symbols, images and stories through collage and assemblages.\r\n\r\nSummer of 2008 she created and invented and new process for her work by layering and combining papers with transparent sheets to build layers and layers of depth between symbols, images and colors to create the inner depth and include found objects with some pieces to add the outer depth to complete the yin and yang multi-dimensions of wholeness she desired in her art. She starts by touching or researching through organic objects that most would want to discard or throw out that she as recycled for years. \r\n\r\nBy feeling it like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle without photo on a box as a guide she lays out pieces on a table intuitively and lets the pieces have comment, message, purpose or idea to convey. From there the idea dictates the forms, shapes, colors, symbolism and images. It comes together like a cosmic dance. London explains, \"I am so involved in the process and the concentration that I lose all sense of time, I forget to eat, drink, and I look up and wonder where the time went?\"\r\n\r\nMost of her pieces are created with all of the universal elements or a reference to nature in them: fire, water, earth, air, wood an inner and outer message or a double entendres. Ms London states, \"The art I create is not meant to be literal or only strictly narrative. It is left open to individual's interpretation and hopefully some type of discovery. My hope is they will connect at some level or identify some of their own personal symbols, memories, or dreams when viewing my work, I am consistently learning through my art process that everything is an continued exploration, involving a mystery with more to learn, grow and discovery from others.\" \r\n\r\nLondon continues, \"My favorite part of the process is finding out how people connect to pieces and why they connect to them and then collect them, There is always a wonderful story, it is like God made it just for them only through me.

There was something about these studies of the nest and the egg that took on a deeply personal meaning, and I decided to try translating it onto a large canvas. I also experimented with adding a technique I once saw in a piece of artwork from Japan, brought in to be framed for a client, which was created using crushed eggshells. When this initial painting was completed, the awareness emerged, like a fledgling from the nest, that I was honoring my family's artistic heritage of portrait painting by seeing the eggs as representing each member of a family. \r\n\r\nThe paintings of the bird’s nests and eggs are created as symbolic \"family portraits\" of what we all hold dear, our home and loved ones.\r\n","artist":{"email":"jrossart@gmail.com","id":815}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"2080 5th Ave","address2":"","city":"San Rafael","first_name":"Jena","last_name":"Rockwood","state":"California","id":734,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/791/6322_10200165876442127_1366679069_n.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/791/preview_6322_10200165876442127_1366679069_n.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/791/thumb_6322_10200165876442127_1366679069_n.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"Jena Rockwood creates rock inspired art which started because of her fascination and love for music, talented musicians, and the intricacy of musical instruments.

Immediately following High School, Meredith moved to a town right outside of Austin, Texas, where she received her double BFA in Painting and Photography in 2010 at Texas State University.  She had the opportunity to take photography and art history classes in Florence, Italy during the summer of 2009.

There, she earned her Masters of Fine Arts in Painting in 2012, while gaining incomparable experience through interaction with her peers, working under incredible mentors, and as a teaching assistant for an undergraduate course at SFAI.

Moments that might seem mundane or insignificant, but that I find to be the true essence of our existence.    I paint both entwined couples and solo figures in emotionally captivating positions.  My loose, expressive painting style is meant to further illustrate the intangible yet complex emotions that we experience as individuals.  I create layers of oil paint to mask or encroach upon the subjects, creating an ambiguous reality.  I like the idea of a color representing someone being enveloped by the space they are in, so that is what a lot of my paintings are dealing with:  the weight of space.

By drawing attention to the process of image construction, I hope that each viewer will discover a more personalized and, perhaps, more meaningful narrative then what a singular interpretative framework could ever hope to provide.

When I begin my process, I always start by stitching, or essentially, drawing with needle and thread.  Reference to printed images of interiors I’ve collected over the years is my guiding point.  Initially attracted to the stunning compositions and thoughtful groupings of shapes, I start by reducing the magazine images into simple sketched line drawings, honing in on a particular shape, curve, or intricate, inviting space that attracts me.  I usually end up scaling the final drawings down or altering them slightly to fit the picture plane I’ve chosen to work on.  I then paste the properly scaled drawing on the back of the canvas. Doing this allows me to get an accurate and precise thread drawing.   The act of constantly handling the small canvas, flipping it from front to back, and poking small holes in its surface, has allowed me to relate to the painting as an object while simultaneously keeping in mind that it still is very much a picture plane.  This has opened  up a sensibility to the duality of painting that I didn’t pay attention to in earlier work.  Once the interior scene is stitched, this conglomerate of shapes is immovable and fixed; therefore, it is the ground area that becomes the playground – always shifting and changing in surface and color, but at the same time remaining faithful to the figure it envelops. Pieces of hand-made paper, wallpaper swatches, tape, paint, and liquid frisket are just some of the materials used to build the space, or more specifically, the surface that is a reaction to the initial stitching. \r\n\r\nI’ve recently begun to think about how this way of making paintings is related to childhood memories I have of playing with dollhouses.    As a youngster, I spent hundreds if not thousands of hours holding, touching, and looking at miniature versions of furniture.   I would obsessively arrange and rearrange furniture and interiors used to replicate much larger versions  of “the real thing”.   So, in a way, this “play memory” is beginning to navigate and inform my painting process.  When I step back and look at paintings that are finished (the good ones, that is), I sometimes sense a quiet, mysterious, slightly magical quality of a secret life of an interior; one completely void of people but alive nonetheless.","artist":{"email":"kim.t.malm@gmail.com","id":844}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"2303 Southeastern Ave.","address2":"","city":"Indianapolis ","first_name":"Katrina","last_name":"West","state":"Indiana","id":780,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/845/5338_Double_Self_Portrait_Color.JPG","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/845/preview_5338_Double_Self_Portrait_Color.JPG"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/845/thumb_5338_Double_Self_Portrait_Color.JPG"}}},"artist_statement":"When I was young I spent a lot of time exploring the woods and countryside near my home in rural Indiana.

Also while studying Medieval coffin sculptures, I learned the sculptures were carved upright and then turned to lie flat on top of the coffin.  Interestingly the folds in the clothing stayed upright giving the sculpture carvings an awkward sensation. I liked this feeling. To me it breathed life into the folds of the carvings.  Somewhere in my mind the idea of painting clothes hanging in closets or bolts of fabric and turning them into a landscape, like the coffin sculptures, merged together.

I attended university and obtained a degree in graphic design and fine art. Upon graduating I worked as a graphic designer and later an art director for 10 years. During this time I continued to build my portfolio of fine art.\r\n\r\nI started out as an artist based in realism, concentrating primarily on animals. I continued to stay in realism when I quit the professional world to pursue a career in fine art. as time passed I continued to hone my craft, moving from realism, into more abstracted pieces.\r\n\r\nMy initial venture into abstracts was in the form of mixed media collages. I began to let go of my graphically precise nature of my painting into a looser form of creativity in my collages. I still continue to create collages today using a variety of mediums, papers and  urban objects.\r\nFinally I moved my focus to abstract paintings. I have progressed into a painter with two distinct styles. My main love affair is with fluid acrylic. The many uses of this medium and the uncertainty of what it can produce make it an exciting challenge to undertake. I have also begun to mix this medium with others, creating mixed media work with great success.\r\n\r\nIn summation, I would describe myself as an abstract artist, with interests also in realism and collage work. The emphasis being on my painting. I am energetic and prolific, and hope to convey this in the artwork I offer for sale.","artist":{"email":"sholznecht@gmail.com","id":953}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"P.O.Box 1962","address2":"","city":"Los Gatos","first_name":"Kerri","last_name":"Linden","state":"California","id":863,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/936/Kerri_Phone_321.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/936/preview_Kerri_Phone_321.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/936/thumb_Kerri_Phone_321.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"With a degree in furniture design and fiber arts, and tremendously successful run in the fashion world (1990's) as a woman's jewelry and accessory designer (Kerri Linden Design,) I returned to my greatest passion... making art for \"art's sake\", in the early 2000's.\r\nMy work is a series of mixed-media paintings, incorporating many of my visual interests/inspirations with fine art skills and my love of collecting \"found objects.\"\r\nFor me, creating art is an ongoing process of expression, and designing visual works that are sophisticated, one-of-a-kind and completely livable in most interior spaces.

I find inspiration in the sights, sounds, and fragrances on these adventures. I take my camera everywhere as my paintings are directly or indirectly influenced by the pictures I take.

My alchemist pursuit is a metaphor to how we interact with the earth. Sometimes the residue is called art, I call it DeJunked.\r\n\r\nThis assemblage process reflects themes of community and sustainability with the collaboration of artist and environment. Taking something used, and reworking it into something new, is a statement about the act of healing. The reclaiming of objects that would eventually inhabit a landfill directly affects our surroundings and it’s inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAesthetic Meditation:\r\nI try not to think too much while working. This somewhat random meditation creates more playful results. Sometimes my work can resemble an aerial view of a city. I don’t think this is a coincidence. Society is put together in a relatively haphazard way: an electric pole here, fence post there, telephone wire over the house. The visual result is an infrastructure of grid-like patterns.\r\n\r\nWe are surrounded by an infinite number of overlapping shapes: the room you’re in, the house, the window to the street, the block, the county line, and so on. My instinctive process of aesthetic organization relates to this collective evolution of a city. As the years pass, the network of objects that congregate become more intricate. The same goes for the art. The longer I work, the more harmonious and intricate the patterns become. But these are not random acts of creativity, they are instinctive choices to create order within color, space, and concept.\r\n\r\nThe Sponge Toothbrush:\r\nSomewhere inside every toothbrush is the memory of you brushing your teeth, the way you brush your teeth, and the way you hold your toothbrush. You might see MY toothbrush in the work, but in a way it becomes YOUR toothbrush. No matter what I try to communicate about something, I don’t think I can compete with that sponge-like quality of objects. So I don’t try to; I just put stuff together and let it speak for itself.","artist":{"email":"erikritter@mac.com","id":1043}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"918 Pampas Dr SE","address2":"","city":"Albuquerque","first_name":"Cloud Face","last_name":"","state":"Nm","id":945,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/1028/photo-26.JPG","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/1028/preview_photo-26.JPG"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/1028/thumb_photo-26.JPG"}}},"artist_statement":"My creation process is all about the moment and can be very visceral.

Art has always been my way to anchor myself in a new place. In the same way writers keep a diary, painting and creating has always been a way for me to understand the world around me, and root myself in a new environment. Painting and creating is my way to comprehend the world around me, and people I meet everywhere I go. \r\nMy approach is driven by the desire to show and explain the world the way I see it. For instance, when I moved to New York a few years back, I started to produce a lot of urban landscapes, as I was exploring the city, such as\" Rue Rouge\", Billyburg\" and \"N 5th St\".  However, my art is not restrained to place I go to, or live in. It also talks about different inspiration, books I read, things I do, and events that have marked me. In March 2011, I painted \"Place Tahrir\" after the Arab Spring in Egypt; \"Radio\" is a piece I made as I was reading a biography of the Che Guevara, and “1Q” is painted after a novel that inspired me.\r\nOnly recently, I have started to include more people in my paintings. Up to a year ago, a large space in my art was dedicated to human silhouettes in general, but not so much to specific people. I developed those silhouettes while attending Central St Martin School in London a few years back, creating characters who are neither male nor female, and always anonymous. To me, the question was never who are those people, but rather what they do, and why they are here; they were part of the environment, part of each landscape. I recently started to get more interested in each silhouette, to include actual people in my paintings. I moved from painting anonymous people to painting people I know, I have met, and I have talked to, people who have influenced me, people I like, and people I dislike. I have grown into being more interested in people around me, and it is a natural evolution for me to start to focus on each little silhouette from my previous urban landscapes, and dedicate my practice to people around me. \r\n\t\r\n","artist":{"email":"faustine@badrichani.com","id":1102}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"301 W 2nd Street","address2":"","city":"Corning","first_name":"Cynthia","last_name":"Todd","state":"New York","id":976,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/1062/0727131554a.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/1062/preview_0727131554a.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/1062/thumb_0727131554a.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"I learned to paint in a representational style at a young age from my mother who also painted.  Over the years, I took a few drawing and painting classes but have learned much from my mistakes, or, I mean, my experience, as I  tried to replicate on canvas exactly what I saw in a photo or a still life. I won a couple of awards with this style of painting but found it painstaking and stopped painting.  Since I found myself busy raising a son, obtaining an education, and working full time, all at the same time, I didn't mind not painting but I often dreamed of someday creating an abstract painting.  I did not believe I had the creative panache to paint in an abstract style but the dream and the urge kept returning.\r\n\r\nAfter I finished my advanced degree and my son grew up,  the urge became constant desire and although I had the time to paint I did not know what to do without a ruler or agonizing over precise replication of color. What a struggle to follow the dream!  One day while developing the techniques unique to my style the creative process  finally emerged.

I paint my interpretation of what has inspired me, what I see, think, or feel. I simply I enjoy the process of creating a painting.

This past year (2012 – 2013) I have been focusing on fine art and painting (especially abstract art).\r\n\r\nFor most of my life I have focused on realism but in doing so have failed to find that certain magic that comes from visually expressing the spiritual aspect of the subject matter.\r\n\r\nConcentrating on abstraction has forced me to focus on color, relationships between colors, and shapes rather than how realistic the subject looks. What starts out in my imagination is taken over by brush strokes which invariably affect the end result. Because there is no implied form in my purely abstract pieces, my hope is that the viewer will be able to find a reflection of that which is within. The image is less arbitrary allowing a more subjective, internal point of view. When approaching the abstract style I am liberated from creating recognizable forms however I do not paint from chaos and allow the imagery to takeover its own creation although I do still listen and feel what the painting needs. Just as in realism, every color and brush stroke is intended however I do find the inspiration comes from a different place which makes it seem like the painting has taken on a life of it’s own.\r\n\r\nThe artworks I create which are not purely abstract are perhaps hybrids of other styles including modernism or impressionism. My intention is to create recognizable forms but express them in a way that brings out the spiritual nature of the subject matter.\r\n\r\nPainting for me is very liberating. It is perhaps one of the most natural forms of expression that I use to share my unique perspective.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that when a chef creates a culinary masterpiece, the food is infused with emotional energy and the same goes when any artist creates. His or her expression is emotional energy fused with craftsmanship–and with a little magic, a masterpiece is created. Whenever I paint, I try to use this energy to help capture the essence of the subject matter in the way that I not only see it, but feel it.","artist":{"email":"andrew@andrewkeola.com","id":1251}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"3013 6th Ave.","address2":"Suite B","city":"Tacoma","first_name":"Therese","last_name":"Tucker","state":"Washington","id":1079,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/1175/therese2.png","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/1175/preview_therese2.png"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/user_profile/profile_image/1175/thumb_therese2.png"}}},"artist_statement":"Therese is an actress, artist, mom, wife and star fairy caught in human form, bringing sparkles and magic to the world one piece of art at a time.

The spinning mandala has shown me this, and it is my duty to show the world the potential of the most ancient and sacred shape of Art, the mandala.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is Perfect.\" I realized one day a long time ago, and i live for the day when we ALL have come to this realization, so that we may all float in the beauty of infinity. I hope my Art can push us closer to these future moments of Perfection. :)\r\n\r\n-diNo","artist":{"email":"dinodinap@aol.com","id":1372}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"40 Waterfall dr Apt B","address2":"","city":"Canton","first_name":"Esin","last_name":"","state":"MA","id":1229,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1229/S5000276.JPG","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1229/preview_S5000276.JPG"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1229/thumb_S5000276.JPG"}}},"artist_statement":"I was born and raised in a small city by the Mediterranean.  \r\nMaking art has always been my secret garden to hide in...

Painting for a living is a dream come true, and one for which I am immensly grateful.\r\n \r\nI've done a lot of portraits for customers celebrating their valuables in life. A portrait is a such a wonderful keepsake to treasure for a lifetime. And I always feel so happy to see that I can make people happy!\r\n \r\nWhile specializing in custom portrait painting, I have a profound love for still-life painting. Guided by a special perspective to light, shadow, color and form, I paint common objects in everyday life. Inspired by Renaissance masters and the seventeenth-century Dutch masters,  I applie my realistic skill in creating still-life of purity, serenity, rationality and harmony.\r\n \r\nI choose pastel as my main media as it never fades, cracks, darkens or yellows. It remains as fresh, colorful and distinct as it is fresh from my hand, as long as it is framed and kept from direct sunlight.  \r\n ","artist":{"email":"sabrinazhou001@gmail.com","id":1521}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"8 Patricia Lane","address2":"","city":"Woodstock ","first_name":"Renee","last_name":"Samuels","state":"NY","id":1265,"profile_image":{"profile_image":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1265/image.jpg","preview":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1265/preview_image.jpg"},"thumb":{"url":"http://cache.arttwo50.com/production/uploads/artist_profile/profile_image/1265/thumb_image.jpg"}}},"artist_statement":"Statement:\r\nRenee Samuels' work can be colorful or dark, playful or serious, but it's always about composition and spirit, her creative energy manifested with line, shape and color. Whether purely abstract or abstracted from the representational with recognizable forms, the works are alive with movement.  Matisse, Morandi and Ben Nicholson are among the most prominent of Renee Samuels' influences. But having looked at her work a viewer will walk away with the conviction that it is 100% original.\r\n\r\nRenee Samuels (b.1958 St. Johnsbury, Vermont) grew up in Waltham, Massachusetts, attended Boston University and moved to Woodstock, New York, in 1987, where she studied drawing, painting and art history with the late Nicholas Buhalis. Exhibiting since 1987, she won a First Prize in a painting show at Woodstock Artists Association and Museum in 1990. Since then she's had 10+ solo exhibitions and participated in over 80 group shows in the Hudson Valley, New Jersey, New York City and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her home and studio are in Woodstock, New York, where she is listed on the Chamber of Commerce's Famous Artists web page.\r\n\r\n\r\n","artist":{"email":"samuelsrenee@gmail.com","id":1443}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"2131 N.

I try to blend Fauvism techniques with a dash of pop art.  One of my favorite artists is Martina Shapiro and my paintings also reflect inspiration of her works as well.  I also love Carrie Evenson's \"free-style\" techniques and her approach to painting (bold, large strokes and lots of free movement).  My educational background is in Psychology and Human Behavior, and my paintings reflect natural raw human emotions contrasted by the unnatural use of colors.  Backgrounds are kept simple so as not to take focus away from the human subject.  Lack of detail in the human face allows the observer to make it uniquely his or hers.  \r\n\r\nI get the inspiration for my human subjects mainly from my patients and clients.  I try to capture the stories of their lives--their stories of loss, loneliness, happiness, joy, and regret--are woven into the painting.  .  \r\n\r\nThere is some slight blending in my works, but mainly I like to keep my brush strokes bold and raw with minimal blending whenever possible.  In many of my works, I actively attempt to avoid blending color altogether to create a \"pop-art\" or \"cartoon\" effect.  The visible defects and flaws in the paint strokes add natural movement and beauty to the painting, greatly reducing any chances of it being duplicated (the image may be duplicated, but the original brush strokes are hard to replicate!).  Every human subject I paint tells his or her own story.

Eise is an artist specializing in painting abstract works noted for their bold colors, textures, and motion. Born in Alaska, she traveled throughout the lower 48 states as a child and worked abroad for nearly five years as a young adult. Missouri is now her (infrequent) home base between her international travels, and she is also often found in DC, NYC and San Francisco.\r\n\r\nJ's paintings, ranging from 8 by 12 inches to 3 by 5 feet, are focused on creating abstract art that is full of motion. Every piece is designed, created and framed with the goal of looking appealing and attractive for a home - while not losing their unique appeal. Each piece's motion and texture speaks to every person differently; as they interpret the emotion captured on the canvas in light of their personal experiences.\r\n\r\nJ picked up a paintbrush six years ago in Cairo, Egypt, without a single painting class under her belt. Fearlessly approaching the canvas, her work has evolved and developed into what you see today. Several pieces of artwork have been commissioned by patrons from San Francisco to the Twin Cities, generally sold by word of mouth, as well as working with Arttwo50. \r\n","artist":{"email":"jessica.eise@gmail.com","id":1797}}},{"artist_profile":{"address1":"801 E.
